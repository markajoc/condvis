condvis: Conditional Visualisation for Statistical Models
=========================================================

Interactively exploring fitted model structures
-----------------------------------------------

Interactively take 2-D and 3-D sections in data space, showing where fitted  
models intersect the section, and observed data near the section according to  
a distance measure.

Works on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

Requirements:
  * Windows: the standard graphics device is sufficient.  
  * Mac OS: Xquartz device, [website](http://www.xquartz.org/)  
  * Linux: X11, included in some distributions.
