  Abstract from original paper: Horseshoe crabs arrive on the beach in pairs and
  spawn in the high intertidal during the springtime, new and full moon high 
  tides. Unattached males also come to the beach, crowd around the nesting 
  couples and compete with attached males for fertilizations. Satellite males 
  form large groups around some couples while ignoring others, resulting in a 
  nonrandom distribution that cannot be explained by local environmental 
  conditions or habitat selection. In experimental manipulations, pairs that had
  satellites regained them after they had been removed whereas pairs with no 
  satellites continued nesting alone, which means that satellites were not 
  simply accumulating around the pairs that had been on the beach the longest. 
  Manipulations also revealed that satellites were not just copying the 
  behaviour of other males. Based on the evidence from observations and 
  experiments, the most likely explanation for the nonrandom distribution of 
  satellite males among nesting pairs is that unattached males are 
  preferentially attracted to some females over others. Females with many 
  satellites were larger and in better condition, but did not lay more eggs, 
  than females with few or no satellites.\cr\cr
