=========================================================

News
---------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3-5
  * In `plotxc`, now chops off long tails for scatterplot/2-d hisotogram.
  * pass plotting parameters for models from top-level `ceplot` call. See
    parameter `modelpar`.
  * allow `xlim` and `ylim` to be passed to section plot produced by `plotxs`.

Version 0.3-4 2016-08-04
  * fixed incorrect parameter names in demo files.
  * fix to `plotxs` to allow `main` and `mar` to be specified.

Version 0.3-3 2016-07-04
  * fixed treatment of `pch` by condtour, was previously defaulting to 1 when it

  * added Roxygen comments for documentation of exported functions.
  * added update methods to parallel coordinates and scatterplot matrix
    condition selector plots.
